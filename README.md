Lab 5: Arrays and Pointers

This lab must be completed by pairs of students. Submissions by individual students will not be accepted under normal circumstances. The intent is that the two students work together.
In this lab you will create a lottery game that generates random whole numbers between 1 and 50. 
The number of these random numbers will depend on the user choice. A user can choose to generate either 3 or 6 or 7 numbers. 
Make sure that no memory is lost by using dynamically allocated arrays and deallocating them when done. You will create a console C++ program to read user input and validate it (both type and range needs to be validated). 
Your program will display the numbers generated and print a message according to their values. The use of functions is highly recommended in this lab.

Getting User Input 
The program should prompt the user for number of random generations needed. 

Input Validation
Must validate for numeric input regarding count of random numbers that needs to be generated. Include range validation in your solutions. The input must be numeric, and the value can be only a 3 or 6 or 7.
If the user input does not meet these requirements, the program should display an appropriate error message and keep re-prompting until a valid input is achieved.

Processing and output
All generated numbers need to be whole numbers.
Your program should print the numbers generated; it should also print a message according to the uniqueness of the numbers. Please refer to the table below for more details.

Testing your Work 
You can use the following values to test your program:
Case number	Uniqueness	Outcome
1	All number are unique	Print a message to say something like:
“First Prize winner, All numbers are unique”
2	At least one number is repeated twice	Print a message to say something like:
“Second Prize winner, A number is repeated twice”
3	At least one number is repeated three times	Print a message to say something like:
“Better luck next time”

General Requirements 
-	Include an opening comment with your name, the name of the program, the date, and a short description. 
-	Follow the style guide! Use descriptive names and sensible datatypes for variables, constants, arrays, functions, etc. that follow our naming conventions. Use good spacing and make sure braces ({}) are located where they are supposed to be. 
-	Output messages must be meaningful. Displaying values is not enough, the user must understand what he is seeing. 
-	Create a 3-to-5-minute video in which you demo running your code, testing it with different values/scenarios and explaining the code included. You will need 2 videos. One video for each group member. Make sure to state your name and id at the beginning of the video.

Submission
-	Make sure to submit your work on DC Connect before due date
-	Submit your .h , .cpp files and the video you created as separate files, no zip files please.
-	Up to -30% deduction if you decide to submit a zip or compressed file
-	 Grades will be granted according to class coding guidelines, professionalism, output clarity and solution ingenuity.
